# Teaching

* Helped teach 5th grade band for several weeks at Emerald Elementary while the school looked for permanent instructor.

# Service

* Learned LOGO to teach to kids

# Highlights
* Hired for a payed internship at NCAR, starting date: Novemeber 10, 2014
* Developed a tool at NREL to automatically generate a database from a folder hiercharchy - each folder becomes a table, files become records. Folder nesting is captured with foreign key links and there is a data merge feature.
* Wirewrapped programmable HC11 computer with LCD screen from individual chips. Programmable via serial port and/or EPROM

Fun programming stuff:
* Edited c source for INT BASIC programming language to compile and run on Matsucom wristwatch
* Wrote checkers engine (recursive postion evaluation) in Saturn assembly for and on HP48G calculator (interesting due to the special-purpose working registers, scratch and stack limitations of the architecture)
